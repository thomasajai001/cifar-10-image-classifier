# cifar-10-image-classifier

This project was built as part of my submittion to [TinkerHub Foundation](https://tinkerhub.org/) Practical AI Bootcamp Selection Task.

### This is a Image Classifier that can classify images as either Ship or Truck.


## Problem Statement

Create a binary classifier to classify images of ships and trucks. Deploy the model and share links to code in GitHub and the API. 

## How does it Work?
The training dataset for the ML model was obtined from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) which was loaded from keras inbuilt datasets.

The image classifier is built on Tensorflow framework using CNN architecture.

The model training was done on Google Colab.
